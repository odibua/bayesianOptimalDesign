# Bayesian Optimal Design

This file contains code that will be used to, given a model, propose the optimal design points for experiments. 
In this case, optimality is defined by a utility function that is derived based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
and is the design points that allow you to perform inferences on model parameters that yield the most information. 
The implementation of Bayesian Optimal Design is simulation based and follows the strategy outlined in [1].
